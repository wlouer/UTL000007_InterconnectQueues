## About me
I'm Billâ€”a power industry professional with 20+ years of experience in power generation. My background as a mechanical engineer led to me a role as project manager where I led the development and execution of power generation projects. These days, I'm diving into data science, visualization, and machine learning with the intention of using it as a tool to uncover insights and improve decision making in power project development, design, procurement, construction and operations.
